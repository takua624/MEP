Authors only excluded a small number of participants from the analysis due to additional criteria (at least one dose of study drug and baseline measurement) and it was balanced between groups. However, a higher number of participants in the zuranolone group (21.4% at day 28 compared to 12.4% in the placebo group) were lost to follow-up or discontinued treatment, so this could have introduced bias. </p>",Low risk,<p>Study protocol is available and all prespecified outcomes are reported.</p>,Unclear risk,"<p>The trial was funded by the drug manufacturer, who appears to have had a considerable role in the design and conduct of the trial.
